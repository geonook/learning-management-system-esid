-- Migration 015b: Optimize RLS Policies for Performance (IDEMPOTENT VERSION)
-- Date: 2025-10-28
-- Version: 015b (Fixed version of 015)
-- Purpose: Fix auth.uid() re-evaluation issue in RLS policies
-- Reference: Supabase Database Linter Warning - auth_rls_initplan
-- Performance Impact: 50-200% query speed improvement
-- ========================================
--
-- IMPORTANT: This is Migration 015b - The Idempotent Version
-- =========================================================
-- This version fixes the "policy already exists" error from Migration 015
-- by adding DROP POLICY IF EXISTS before all CREATE POLICY statements.
--
-- Changes from Migration 015:
--   1. Added header explaining this is version 015b
--   2. Added DROP IF EXISTS before Part 11 (service_role_bypass) policies
--   3. Added DROP IF EXISTS before Part 12 (authenticated_read) policies
--
-- This migration can be safely re-executed multiple times.
-- ========================================

-- ========================================
-- Background: Why This Migration is Needed
-- ========================================
--
-- Supabase Database Linter detected that our RLS policies are calling
-- auth.uid() and auth.jwt() directly, which causes PostgreSQL to
-- re-evaluate these functions for EVERY ROW in query results.
--
-- Example Problem:
--   SELECT * FROM users WHERE ...
--   -> If query returns 1000 rows, auth.uid() executes 1000 times!
--
-- Solution:
--   Use subquery: (SELECT auth.uid())
--   -> auth.uid() executes ONCE, result is cached for entire query
--
-- Reference: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security#call-functions-with-select
