üìã NEXT STEPS:
1. If test accounts are MISSING, you need to:
   a) Go to Supabase Auth Users panel
   b) Create users manually OR
   c) Run the primary school test data script
   
2. If courses are MISSING, you need to:
   a) Import the full test data script
   b) Or manually create courses for testing
   
3. Once data is ready, test at: http://localhost:3000
